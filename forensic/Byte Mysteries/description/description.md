Description:

In 2024, a crucial message about a top-secret World War III operation was hidden within an image by a secret agent. This message isn't easily accessible, as each bit of the message has been concealed within the pixels of the image, and it can only be retrieved through a very specific method. Your task is to uncover the hidden message within the image named "secret".

## TL;DR

1. Open the file "secret.png".
2. Identify and extract the hidden bits from each pixel of the image.
3. Combine these bits to reveal the hidden message.
4. Decode the message hidden in the image to get the flag.

## Hint

- Each pixel in the image contains several bits of the message within its RGB components.
