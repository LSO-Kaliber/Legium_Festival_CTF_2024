## Description

Difficulty : Medium

Description : 

I'm genuinely confused, my friend told me that everything I need to decrypt the ciphertext is in the binary, but I don't even understand what I'm looking at right now. Please help ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

## TL;DR

- Recover the functions from the binary by using IDA or other similar tools.
- Rewrite them for easier understanding,
- You can use AI or do it manually, create decryption function, decrypt the ciphertext.

## Hint 

- You know you can use AI to help you in rewriting the code right?
